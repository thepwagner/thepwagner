ðŸ‘‹, I'm Pete (he/him).

## What I'm Hacking

### Supply chain security

I'm interested in SLSA, and establishing trust in builds that are nachos (not yours).

### Automated dependency management

I want robots to manage dependencies for me.
I've contributed to [Dependabot](https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core), [Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate) and [built a framework for dependency management on GitHub Actions](https://github.com/thepwagner/action-update).

These days I use Renovate the most, from the [wapwagner](https://github.com/wapwagner) account.

### Event-driven architectures

Inspired by too much Factorio playtime, I'm fiddling with decoupled workers collaborating through a main bus for personal automation while waiting for Factorio 2.
